# Mobile Dashboard Components

## Overview
This implementation adds a clean and minimal mobile dashboard interface , built with Vue 3, Vite, and TypeScript. The dashboard preserves all existing functionality while adding a modern, mobile-first interface.

## Features
- **Three-page navigation**: Home, History, and Settings
- **Fixed top navigation bar** with smooth animations
- **Modern blue-toned theme** with gradients and shadows
- **Touch-friendly UI elements** optimized for mobile devices
- **Smooth page transitions** with custom animations
- **Responsive design** that works across different screen sizes

## Components Added

### Core Components
- `MobileDashboard.vue` - Main dashboard component with tab-based navigation
- `MobileDashboardRouter.vue` - Router-based dashboard (alternative implementation)
- `DashboardNav.vue` - Navigation component with tab switching
- `DashboardNavRouter.vue` - Router-based navigation component

### Page Components
- `HomePage.vue` - Main dashboard with detection button and statistics
- `HistoryPage.vue` - Detection history with search and filtering
- `SettingsPage.vue` - App settings and preferences

## Integration
The dashboard is integrated into `App.vue` with a toggle button that allows switching between:
- **Dashboard Mode**: New mobile interface (default)
- **Original Mode**: Existing camera preview interface

## Design Features
- **Shazam-inspired circular action button** on the home page
- **Gradient backgrounds** with modern blue tones
- **Card-based layouts** with subtle shadows and rounded corners
- **Smooth hover effects** and transitions
- **Large touch targets** for better mobile usability

## Dependencies Added
- `@fortawesome/fontawesome-free` - For navigation and interface icons

## Usage
The dashboard automatically starts in mobile mode. Users can:
1. **Navigate** between pages using the top navigation bar
2. **Start detection** using the large circular button on the home page
3. **View history** of past detections with search functionality
4. **Adjust settings** including confidence thresholds and preferences
5. **Switch views** using the floating toggle button (development feature)

## Existing Functionality Preserved
- All original camera components (`CameraPreview.vue`, `DetectionOverlay.vue`)
- Camera service functionality
- Original app layout and styling
- Vue + Vite development setup

## Technical Implementation
- Uses Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript
- Implements both tab-based and router-based navigation patterns
- Maintains responsive design principles
- Follows modern CSS practices with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Includes proper accessibility considerations

## Future Enhancements
- Add data persistence with Pinia store
- Implement actual API integration for detection history
- Add more customization options in settings
- Include offline functionality
- Add notification system for detection alerts
